# Structure

The structure is perhaps the **most** important component of DataBin as it shows your current workspace.

It allows you to add, delete, edit, rename and change type of **tags**.

The File tag (<Image src="FileIcon"/>) can be renamed or tags can be added inside. This is the most **fundamental** tag.
